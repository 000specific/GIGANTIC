# Research Notebook

**Your project's research documentation hub.**

---

## Philosophy

**AI sessions ARE research.**

Working with an AI assistant on computational biology is equivalent to working at the bench. It produces results, insights, and decisions that need to be documented - just like wet-lab experiments.

This directory is your research notebook for AI-assisted computational work.

## Structure

```
research_notebook/
├── research_user/     # Your personal workspace (no structure requirements)
└── research_ai/       # AI-generated documentation (structured)
```

### `research_user/`

**Your playground.** Use it for anything:
- Personal notes
- Literature references
- Draft manuscripts
- Meeting notes
- Exploratory analyses

Organize it however works for you.

### `research_ai/`

**Consolidated AI documentation** - organized like lab notebook sections:
- `project/` - project-level sessions
- `subproject-phylonames/` - phylonames work
- `subproject-genomesDB/` - genomesDB work
- ...and so on for each subproject

Each section contains: sessions, validation, logs, debugging.

See `research_ai/README.md` for complete details.

## Why Separate?

- Your personal organization stays unconstrained
- AI-generated content is clearly identified
- Both are preserved for scientific record
- Easy to find what you need

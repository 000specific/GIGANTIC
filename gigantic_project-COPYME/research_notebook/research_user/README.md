## Organization

Organize however works for you. Some ideas:

```
research_user/
├── literature/           # Papers and references
├── notes/                # Personal documentation
├── drafts/               # Manuscript drafts
├── figures/              # Work-in-progress figures
├── meetings/             # Meeting notes
└── exploratory/          # Quick analyses
```

Or don't organize at all - it's up to you.

# GIGANTIC Conventions

Canonical conventions for the GIGANTIC framework. Each entry is verified against the codebase.

This file grows as conventions surface during per-directory documentation review.
At the end of cleanup, this is the source for writing the top-level `GIGANTIC/` and
`gigantic_project-COPYME/` README + AI_GUIDE pairs.

---

## 1. `research_notebook/` is a sandbox, outside GIGANTIC conventions — and there is ONE, at project root only

There is **exactly one** `research_notebook/` per project, at the
project root: `gigantic_project-COPYME/research_notebook/`. Per-subproject
`research_notebook/` directories are forbidden. (Earlier templates
allowed per-subproject and per-BLOCK/STEP sandboxes; that pattern was
consolidated — the per-subproject dirs were inconsistent in practice
and the chat-capture system always wrote to the project-root location
anyway.)

The project-root sandbox has:

- **No structure requirements** — any files, any naming, any subdirectory layout
- **No naming conventions** — users organize however they like

The only hard rule: **GIGANTIC must never pull from anything inside
`research_notebook/`.** Workflows, scripts, and pipelines treat it as
invisible.

If a user wants GIGANTIC to use a file that lives in
`research_notebook/`, they symlink it into
`gigantic_project-COPYME/INPUT_user/` (the canonical project-level
input directory). GIGANTIC reads from `INPUT_user/`, never from
`research_notebook/`.

This separation is what lets `research_notebook/` stay completely
free-form while GIGANTIC's reproducibility guarantees remain intact.

**Per-subproject scoping** (when useful): organize inside the project-root
sandbox with `subproject-<name>/` subdirs, e.g.:

```
research_notebook/
├── research_user/
│   ├── subproject-genomesDB/   # user's per-subproject scratch
│   ├── subproject-phylonames/
│   └── species70/              # or any user-defined organization
└── research_ai/
    ├── sessions/               # chat captures (per §9)
    └── subproject-phylonames/  # AI-side per-subproject scratch (when needed)
```

But this is a convenience pattern, not a requirement — the sandbox is free-form.

---

## 2. Inter-subproject data flow: `OUTPUT_pipeline/` → `output_to_input/` symlinks

Real data lives in `OUTPUT_pipeline/` inside each workflow-RUN directory. To share
specific outputs with downstream subprojects:

- A subproject exposes its sharable outputs at `<subproject>/output_to_input/`
  (lowercase `o`)
- Entries inside `output_to_input/` are **symlinks** pointing into the canonical
  `OUTPUT_pipeline/` of the appropriate `workflow-RUN_N-*` directory
- The directory structure inside `output_to_input/` is organized by
  `STEP_<N>-<name>/` or `BLOCK_<name>/` subdirectories matching the
  producer's structure. This keeps sequential runs from overwriting each
  other and preserves clear provenance (consumer sees which step generated
  what)

Downstream subprojects always read from `<upstream_subproject>/output_to_input/`,
never from inside an `OUTPUT_pipeline/` directly.

**Note on a deprecated pattern**: an older CLAUDE.md described an `OUTPUT_to_input/`
(uppercase `O`) archival mirror inside each `workflow-RUN_N-*` directory. That
pattern is **not** implemented in any current GIGANTIC workflow code or
documentation — verified by full-tree grep (0 mentions in `.md`, `.nf`, `.py`,
`.sh`; 0 directories on disk inside the framework). Treat the lowercase symlink
pattern above as the only `output_to_input` convention.

---

## 3. AI guide files are always named `AI_GUIDE.md` — no suffixes

Just like README files are always `README.md`, AI guide files are always
`AI_GUIDE.md` — no descriptor suffix, no level suffix, no workflow-name suffix.

- `README.md` and `AI_GUIDE.md` are the only two doc filenames at every level
- The directory the file lives in establishes its scope (project, subproject,
  BLOCK/STEP, workflow). No need to repeat that scope in the filename.
- Old patterns like `AI_GUIDE-project.md`, `AI_GUIDE-trees_species.md`,
  `AI_GUIDE-trees_species_workflow.md`, `AI_GUIDE-phylonames_workflow.md` are
  all deprecated. Each should be renamed to `AI_GUIDE.md` in its own directory.

This convention was established earlier in development but drifted across
sessions; it is being re-enforced as part of the documentation cleanup pass.

---

## 4. The GIGANTIC repo is everything from `GIGANTIC/` downward

The GitHub-versioned project is the `GIGANTIC/` directory. Anything upstream of
it — parent directories, sibling user workspaces, lab-specific scaffolding — is
user research context and has **no relevance to GIGANTIC** or its conventions.

For example, in the development environment used to build GIGANTIC, the repo
lives inside `…/ai_ctenophores/github-gigantic_1/GIGANTIC/`. The
`ai_ctenophores/` directory is the developer's personal research workspace; it
is not part of GIGANTIC, does not constrain GIGANTIC, and does not appear in
any path users will see.

---

## 5. Paths inside `gigantic_project-COPYME/` are written relative to it

Once a path falls inside `gigantic_project-COPYME/` (or its renamed copy in a
user's project, e.g. `gigantic_project-cephalopod_evolution/`), document it
relative to that directory — not absolute, and not relative to the GIGANTIC
repo root.

- ✅ `subprojects/phylonames/STEP_1-generate_and_evaluate/`
- ✅ `ai/ai_FYIs/gigantic_conventions.md`
- ❌ `gigantic_project-COPYME/subprojects/phylonames/STEP_1-generate_and_evaluate/`
- ❌ `/blue/moroz/share/edsinger/.../gigantic_project-COPYME/subprojects/phylonames/STEP_1-generate_and_evaluate/`

This makes documentation portable across renamed project copies and across
machines. The user reads their `gigantic_project-<name>/` as the root of their
work; docs should respect that frame of reference.

---

## 6. AI-related infrastructure lives under `ai/`

All AI-related infrastructure inside `gigantic_project-COPYME/` is consolidated
under one top-level directory: `ai/`. This makes the AI plumbing visually
obvious to users browsing the project tree.

Current layout:

```
gigantic_project-COPYME/
├── ai/
│   ├── README.md                # What's in ai/
│   ├── ai_FYIs/                 # Markdown notes, conventions, archives, FYIs
│   │   └── gigantic_conventions.md
│   └── ai_scripts/              # Python tooling (capture hook, "Save Chat!" script, etc.)
│       ├── 002_ai-python-hook_precompact_capture_transcript.py
│       └── 003_ai-python-copy_session_jsonls.py
└── …
```

Anything new that is AI-internal goes under `ai/`. Anything user-facing
(`README.md`, `INPUT_user/`, `subprojects/`, etc.) stays at project root or in
its appropriate user-facing location.

---

## 7. `.claude/` exception: `gigantic_project-COPYME/.claude/` ships the capture hook + its docs

**General rule**: no `.claude/` directories anywhere in GitHub. Claude Code
session settings are developer-personal and gitignored everywhere by default.

**Deliberate exception**: `gigantic_project-COPYME/.claude/` ships **exactly
three files**, all tracked:

- `settings.json` — registers the PreCompact hook that calls
  `ai/ai_scripts/002_ai-python-hook_precompact_capture_transcript.py` to
  capture full lossless session transcripts to
  `research_notebook/research_ai/sessions/` before each context compaction.
- `README.md` — explains what this `.claude/` is and why it ships.
- `AI_GUIDE.md` — guard rails for AIs working inside `.claude/`.

Nothing else inside `gigantic_project-COPYME/.claude/` ships. The
`.gitignore` enforces this with: blanket `.claude/` ignore, then explicit
un-ignore of just these three files at this one path.

This exception exists because **Claude is the recommended AI for GIGANTIC** and
**lossless session capture is a primary GIGANTIC feature** (see §9). Without
the shipped hook config, each user would have to manually wire up capture in
their renamed project copy — defeating the "fresh AI session in renamed
project" model.

The exception is scoped tightly: only `gigantic_project-COPYME/.claude/`
ships, and only these three files inside it. `.claude/` at GIGANTIC root
and `.claude/` anywhere else stay fully gitignored.

---

## 8. AIs read `AI_*`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `README.md` on entry to any directory where they will work

At session start AND every time the working scope shifts to a new directory,
an AI should read the local guidance files if present:

- `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code loads this automatically; other AIs should too)
- `AI_BEHAVIOR.md` (research-grade behavior; canonical, AI-agnostic)
- `AI_GUIDE.md` (how to work in this scope)
- `README.md` (project / subproject / workflow background)

"Working in a directory" means: about to edit, create, run, or otherwise
modify files in that directory or its descendants. Read-only exploration
(grep, ls, find) does not trigger this — but as soon as the AI is about to
do work, it should orient itself by reading these files.

Prevents the failure mode where an AI does 50 turns of work inside a deep
subdirectory without ever reading the local guidance, missing conventions or
constraints documented right there.

---

## 9. Chat-as-research-notebook: lossless permanent captures, never edited; "Save Chat!" for on-demand capture

Every AI chat session is treated as a research-notebook entry. The default
mechanism for Claude Code is fully automatic:

- The PreCompact hook (registered by `gigantic_project-COPYME/.claude/settings.json`)
  fires before every context compaction and gzip-copies the full JSONL
  transcript to `research_notebook/research_ai/sessions/`.
- Captures are **lossless** (full fidelity, every message, every tool call,
  every result), **permanent** (never auto-deleted by GIGANTIC), and
  **never edited** (treat as original lab-notebook entries).
- A `TRANSCRIPT_CAPTURE_LOG.md` in the sessions directory tracks each capture.

**On-demand capture via "Save Chat!"**: users can type **"Save Chat!"** to
their AI at any point to trigger an on-demand capture (the AI runs the
appropriate `ai/ai_scripts/` script). Recommended moments: at milestones,
before signoff, periodically during long sessions. AIs should also
proactively suggest capture when they sense the user is winding down
("done for the day", "let me stop here", closing-the-laptop signals) or
when a significant milestone has just completed.

**TTL gap** (worth knowing): Claude Code stores raw session JSONL at
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/*.jsonl` and auto-deletes after a default
30 days. The PreCompact hook captures only what's been through compaction.
To close the gap for short sessions that never compact:

1. Users should set `cleanupPeriodDays` to a large number in their global
   `~/.claude/settings.json` (one-line manual change), AND
2. The on-demand capture script (`ai/ai_scripts/003_ai-python-copy_session_jsonls.py`)
   raw-copies all `~/.claude/projects/...` JSONLs for this project into
   `research_notebook/research_ai/sessions/` so they survive TTL. AI runs
   it when the user types "Save Chat!" or proactively offers capture.

**Publication scrub**: captured transcripts may contain frank language, draft
hypotheses, collaborator names in unflattering context, credentials/tokens
that leaked into commands, etc. For public submission (journal supplementary
materials, etc.), make **copies** and scrub the copies. **Never modify the
originals** — they are the canonical research record.

**For non-Claude AIs** (Cursor, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.): the principle is the
same — lossless, permanent, never-edited captures with on-demand "Save Chat!"
triggers. The mechanism differs by AI: see `AI_BEHAVIOR.md` and `AI_GUIDE.md`
in the project for AI-specific setup guidance. The non-Claude AI works with
the user to identify where their AI stores session data and to wire up an
equivalent periodic raw-copy into `research_notebook/research_ai/sessions/`.

---

## 10. Three documentation roles: CLAUDE.md, AI_GUIDE.md, README.md

Each level of the project carries up to three docs with **distinct audiences
and roles**:

| File | Audience | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI | **Behavior / posture** in this work — research-grade, full documentation, transparency, archival, replication-enabling. *Not* technical conventions. |
| `AI_GUIDE.md` | AI | **How to work** in this directory / subproject / workflow — operational, navigational, "do X then Y." |
| `README.md` | User | **Biology + technology background**, technical specifics and requirements the user needs to know. |

Keep them in their roles. Don't drift technical conventions into `CLAUDE.md`;
don't drift user-facing background into `AI_GUIDE.md`. Each doc earns its
keep by serving exactly one audience.

---

## 11. `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AI_BEHAVIOR.md` import

`AI_BEHAVIOR.md` holds the canonical research-grade behavior content (any
AI can read it directly). `CLAUDE.md` is one line — `@AI_BEHAVIOR.md` —
which Claude Code auto-loads-and-expands via its documented `@`-import
syntax. Single source of truth, no drift, no symlink fragility.

Verified Anthropic feature: `@path/to/file.md` import in CLAUDE.md is
supported (relative resolves from the file containing the import; max
5 hops of recursive imports).

---

## 12. AI attribution headers on AI-authored files

Every AI-authored script or substantive doc carries an attribution comment
block at the top. Two equivalent forms:

**Single-line (Python/bash scripts)**:
```python
# AI: Claude Code | Opus 4.7 (1M context) | 2026 May 25 | Purpose: Brief description
# Human: Eric Edsinger
```

**Multi-line HTML comment block (markdown docs)**:
```markdown
<!-- ============================================================================
AI:      Claude Code | Opus 4.7 (1M context) | 2026 May 25
Human:   Eric Edsinger
Purpose: One-paragraph statement of why this file exists
Scope:   What this file covers and what it does not
History:
  2026-05-25  Initial version (Opus 4.7).
============================================================================ -->
```

Markdown HTML comments are stripped by Claude Code before injection into
context, so they cost no AI context tokens.

---

## 13. Empty placeholder docs are an antipattern

Don't ship `README.md` or `AI_GUIDE.md` files that are 0 bytes or
"to-be-filled" stubs. Either fill them with real content, or delete them
and rely on the parent-directory docs.

An empty doc that other docs reference creates the worst combination:
the reader expects content (because it's referenced), opens the file, and
finds nothing. The empty-then-referenced `AI_GUIDE-project.md` in
`gigantic_project-COPYME/` and the empty `CLAUDE.md` in `GIGANTIC/` were
both surfaced and removed during the 2026-05-25 cleanup pass.

---

## 14. User flow: clone → copy template → rename → root AI session there

The canonical way to start a GIGANTIC project:

1. `git clone` the GIGANTIC repo
2. `cp -r GIGANTIC/gigantic_project-COPYME /path/outside/GIGANTIC/gigantic_project-<your-project-name>`
3. Start a **fresh, naive AI assistant session rooted at the renamed
   project directory** (not at `GIGANTIC/`)
4. All subsequent project work happens through AI sessions rooted at the
   renamed project.

Project naming convention: `gigantic_project-<your_project_name>`. The
copied directory lives **outside** the `GIGANTIC/` clone so framework
updates can be pulled without touching the user's project.

---

## 15. The renamed project directory is self-contained and archivable

Every input, output, workflow, subproject, AI session record, conda env
spec, and piece of project-specific documentation lives **inside** the
renamed `gigantic_project-<name>/` directory. The directory travels
independently of `GIGANTIC/` and can be archived (or shared with
collaborators) as the **complete record of one research project**.

Implication: no project-specific information should ever be required from
the surrounding GIGANTIC clone or from the user's broader machine —
everything needed must live inside the renamed project (or under
`~/.claude/`, which is per-user not per-project).

---

## 16. Framework-development sessions are a separate scope

AI sessions rooted at `GIGANTIC/` are for **framework development** —
improving the template, conventions, top-level docs. They are not for
project work.

This is why the research-grade behavior docs (`CLAUDE.md`,
`AI_BEHAVIOR.md`) live at the `gigantic_project-COPYME/` level, not at
`GIGANTIC/` root: research-grade posture is project-scope.

If a user opens an AI session at `GIGANTIC/` and asks for project work,
the AI redirects them per the project root's `AI_GUIDE.md`.

---

## 17. INPUT_user is the single staging arena between user data and GIGANTIC

There is **one and only one** `INPUT_user/` directory in any GIGANTIC
project: at `gigantic_project-COPYME/INPUT_user/`. It is the **sole**
interface through which the user makes outside data available to GIGANTIC
subprojects. No other path through which user data reaches subprojects
exists by design.

Inside subprojects, individual workflows may download outside resources
specific to their needs (e.g., reference databases); that handling is
per-subproject. But anything the user themselves provides flows through
`INPUT_user/`.

---

## 18. INPUT_user contains symlinks (relative, via `ln -srf`), not data files — at any depth

All non-doc content inside `INPUT_user/` — at every depth, including
subproject-specific subdirs like `INPUT_user/phylonames/user_phylonames.tsv`
or `INPUT_user/genomic_resources/genomes/<species>.fasta` — is a **symlink**
into `research_notebook/research_user/` (the user's sandbox per §1).

Use **relative** symlinks: `ln -srf <target> <link>` creates them
automatically. Relative symlinks survive when the entire project is moved,
copied to another machine, or archived. Absolute symlinks break.

The user's actual files live in `research_notebook/research_user/`
unstructured per §1; `INPUT_user/` exposes specific files to GIGANTIC via
deliberate symlinks. The symlink graph of `INPUT_user/` is the complete
catalog of what the project feeds into GIGANTIC.

Audit commands:
- `find INPUT_user -xtype l` — broken symlinks (sandbox file moved or deleted)
- `find INPUT_user -type l -exec ls -la {} \;` — all symlinks and their targets

---

## 19. INPUT_user structure is subproject-driven

The conventional subdirectories inside `INPUT_user/` (e.g., `species_set/`,
`genomic_resources/{genomes,proteomes,annotations,maps}/`, `phylonames/`)
reflect what current GIGANTIC subprojects expect. The structure is not
hard-coded by the framework — it grows as subprojects declare their input
requirements.

When a new subproject needs a new kind of user-provided input that
doesn't fit existing locations, the convention is:

1. Add the new subdir under `INPUT_user/<subproject>/` (or extend an
   existing subdir if the input type fits).
2. Add a `README.md` in the new subdir describing what gets staged there.
3. Document the requirement in the subproject's own docs as well.
4. Update `INPUT_user/README.md` if the new convention is broad.

This is mirrored by §22 below: `ai/ai_FYIs/` uses similar subproject-first
naming for related documents.

---

## 20. INPUT_user ships only documentation; user content is gitignored

The shipped GIGANTIC template provides only the doc scaffold inside
`INPUT_user/` (README.md, AI_GUIDE.md, subdir READMEs). All actual user
content — symlinks, manifests, species lists, custom phyloname overrides
— is gitignored. The user's project-specific staging arena stays on their
local disk only.

`.gitignore` enforces this with: `**/gigantic_project-COPYME/INPUT_user/**`
ignored, with `*.md` files un-ignored at any depth so the doc scaffold
travels with the template.

---

## 21. AI scripts: `NNN_ai-<lang>-<descriptor>.<ext>` naming

Scripts inside `ai/ai_scripts/` (and any AI-authored scripts elsewhere)
follow the convention:

```
NNN_ai-<lang>-<descriptor>.<ext>
```

- `NNN` — sequential three-digit number (001, 002, 003, ...)
- `_ai-` — marks the script as AI-authored
- `<lang>` — language indicator (`python`, `bash`, etc.)
- `<descriptor>` — concise underscore-separated description
- `<ext>` — file extension matching the language

Examples:
- `002_ai-python-hook_precompact_capture_transcript.py`
- `003_ai-python-copy_session_jsonls.py`
- `004_ai-bash-create_output_to_input_symlinks.sh`

When a script is invoked by another system (a hook, another script), the
invoking system uses the **literal filename** — not wildcards like
`003_*.py` — so future siblings (e.g., `003_X-other.py`) don't create
ambiguity.

---

## 22. `ai/ai_FYIs/` file naming: subproject-prefix where applicable

Files inside `ai/ai_FYIs/` follow this naming hierarchy:

- **Subproject-specific docs**: prefix with the subproject name —
  `<subproject>-<descriptor>.md` (e.g., `phylonames-overview-old.md`,
  `trees_gene_groups-HANDOFF-2026may25-snap_family_and_step2_3_state.md`).
  This keeps related FYIs sorted together alphabetically.
- **Project-wide docs**: no subproject prefix
  (e.g., `gigantic_conventions.md`, `NEXTFLOW_26_COMPATIBILITY.md`,
  `publication_scrub_guide.md`).
- **Archived versions of deprecated docs**: suffix with `-old`
  (e.g., `phylonames-overview-old.md`).

---

## 23. NextFlow source files use `${projectDir}` for path construction

The relative-path convention (§5) holds for NextFlow `.nf` files via the
`${projectDir}` idiom. `${projectDir}` is a NextFlow built-in that
resolves to the absolute path of the directory containing the running
`main.nf` at runtime.

```groovy
script:
"""
python3 ${projectDir}/scripts/001_ai-python-validate_inputs.py \\
    --config ${projectDir}/../START_HERE-user_config.yaml \\
    --output_dir ${projectDir}/../${params.output.base_dir}
"""

publishDir "${projectDir}/../${params.output.base_dir}/1-output", mode: 'copy'
```

Source stays portable (paths are relative to `projectDir`); resolved
paths at runtime are absolute (and unique per workflow run). Both
properties hold simultaneously — no exception to §5 is needed for
NextFlow.

---

## 24. NextFlow runtime artifacts are gitignored

Files NextFlow generates at run time contain absolute paths and per-run
state. They never ship with the template:

- `work/` — staging directory for process executions
- `.nextflow/` — internal NextFlow state
- `.nextflow.log*` — NextFlow logs
- `.params.json` — per-run flattened-JSON params file (contains absolute
  paths from `${projectDir}` expansion)

All four are in `.gitignore`. When clearing a stuck run, deleting these
+ re-running fresh (no `-resume`) is the canonical reset.

---

## 25. `research_user/` ships as empty directory; `research_ai/` ships with documentation

Refines §1 (and applies only to the single project-root
`research_notebook/` — per-subproject `research_notebook/` directories
are forbidden):

- `research_notebook/research_user/` is the user's wild-west sandbox. The
  template ships only the empty directory (`.gitkeep` only — no README,
  no scaffolding). Per §1, GIGANTIC never reaches into it; users
  organize however they want.
- `research_notebook/research_ai/` is **GIGANTIC's own sandbox**.
  Documentation appropriate to AI infrastructure (capture system, etc.)
  ships here, including `README.md` and the `sessions/.gitkeep` so the
  capture destination is preserved.

Captured session transcripts (per §9) land in
`research_notebook/research_ai/sessions/` and are gitignored as runtime
content — they never ship.

---

## 26. TRANSCRIPT_CAPTURE_LOG.md schema and trigger vocabulary

The capture log written by 002 (hook) and 003 (Save Chat! script) uses
exactly this schema:

```markdown
| Date | Session ID | Model | Trigger | Transcript Size | Output File |
|------|------------|-------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
```

**Trigger values**:
- `auto` — PreCompact hook fired automatically
- `manual` — PreCompact hook invoked manually
- `save_chat` — On-demand "Save Chat!" via 003

Both scripts produce schema-compatible rows; they share the file.

---

## 27. Session capture filename format (Claude Code)

The PreCompact hook (002) and Save Chat! script (003) both produce
`.jsonl.gz` files in `research_notebook/research_ai/sessions/` with this
filename format:

```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS-claude_code-<model-with-underscores>-<8-char-session-id>.jsonl.gz
```

Example:
```
20260306_014426-claude_code-claude_opus_4_6-44529712.jsonl.gz
```

- Timestamp = last-message timestamp from the JSONL content (so the same
  source file at the same state produces the same destination filename,
  enabling idempotent re-runs)
- Model with hyphens replaced by underscores (e.g., `claude-opus-4-7` →
  `claude_opus_4_7`)
- First 8 characters of the session UUID

For other AIs, use an analogous format with the AI's name in the
`claude_code` slot.

---

## 28. Per-subproject conda environments — no central `conda_environments/`

Each subproject manages its own conda environment(s), usually defined in
the subproject's `ai/conda_environment.yml` (or per-tool yml files for
multi-tool subprojects). The subproject's `RUN-workflow.sh` creates the
environment lazily on first run if it doesn't already exist.

A central `gigantic_project-COPYME/conda_environments/` directory existed
in older GIGANTIC versions but is deprecated and removed. It produced a
disconnect between "where I'm working" and "where my env definition
lives"; the per-subproject pattern keeps everything co-located.

Env naming convention: `aiG-<subproject>-<block_or_step>-<optional_details>`
(established earlier; verify against subproject's `ai/conda_environment.yml`
header comment).

---

## 29. Unified `RUN-workflow.sh` is the canonical driver

Each workflow has a single canonical entry point: `RUN-workflow.sh`. It
handles local execution AND self-submits to SLURM when the YAML config's
`execution_mode` key is set to `slurm`. There is no separate
`RUN-workflow.sbatch` in the canonical pattern — that was an older
two-file approach now deprecated.

The unified driver:
- Reads `START_HERE-user_config.yaml`
- Sets up conda env on first run
- For SLURM: writes a per-run sbatch wrapper and submits it
- For local: invokes NextFlow directly
- Cleans up runtime artifacts on exit

The canonical example (most recently modernized) is the
`annotations_X_ocl` subproject's workflow.

---

## 30. This file is the canonical source of truth for conventions

`gigantic_project-COPYME/ai/ai_FYIs/gigantic_conventions.md` is the
authoritative list of GIGANTIC conventions. Other documents reference
section numbers here rather than duplicating content:

```markdown
See `ai/ai_FYIs/gigantic_conventions.md` §9 for the chat-as-research-notebook
architecture.
```

When a convention is updated here, downstream references stay valid as
long as they point at section numbers. **Don't renumber existing
sections** — append new ones; if a section is genuinely deprecated, mark
it `~~§N~~ DEPRECATED — see §M`.

---

## 31. Pipeline output file naming: `N_ai-<descriptor>.<ext>`

Outputs written by pipeline scripts follow the convention:

```
N_ai-<descriptor>.<ext>
```

where `N` is the **invoking script's number with leading zeros removed**
(e.g., script `005_ai-python-generate_blast_commands.py` writes outputs
named `5_ai-blast_commands.sh` into `OUTPUT_pipeline/5-output/`).

Why drop leading zeros in outputs (vs script names which keep them)?
Output file lists are typically short enough that alphabetical sorting
doesn't need the leading zeros, and `5_ai-...` reads more naturally than
`005_ai-...`. Scripts retain `NNN` because directories accumulating many
scripts benefit from the zero-padding for ordering.

The pairing — `NNN_ai-script.py` → `OUTPUT_pipeline/N-output/N_ai-result.tsv` —
makes the script-to-output mapping immediately readable.

---

## 32. Python variable naming conventions

GIGANTIC Python code uses these naming patterns consistently:

| Pattern | Use for | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `input_X` / `input_X_Y_Z` | All inputs (files, paths, data) | `input_fasta_all_species`, `input_genome_data` |
| `output_X` / `output_X_Y_Z` | All outputs (files, paths, data) | `output_arm_counts`, `output_summary_table` |
| `Xs___Ys` (three underscores) | Dictionaries; plural keys-set + plural values-set | `identifiers___sequences`, `species_names___genome_sizes` |
| `Xs` (plural) | Lists | `sequences`, `identifiers`, `genome_sizes` |
| `X` (singular) | Iteration variable inside a loop over `Xs` | `for sequence in sequences:` |
| `parts_X` | Result of splitting variable `X` | `parts_annotation_string = annotation_string.split('|')` |
| `line` + `parts` | TSV/CSV row parsing | `line = line.strip(); parts = line.split('\t')` |

Use full words, not abbreviations (`sequence_count` not `seq_cnt`).
Established scientific abbreviations (GO, Pfam, BLAST) are kept as-is.

---

## 33. Python spacing: spaces inside brackets (intentional PEP 8 deviation)

GIGANTIC Python uses spaces **inside** parentheses, square brackets, and
curly braces, and around operators. This intentionally deviates from PEP 8
in favor of human readability for the research audience.

```python
# GIGANTIC style
species_list = [ 'Octopus', 'Aplysia', 'Homo' ]
genome_data = { 'species': 'Octopus', 'size': 2700000000 }
if species_count == 8:
    open( 'species.fasta', 'r' )

# NOT GIGANTIC style (standard PEP 8)
species_list = ['Octopus', 'Aplysia', 'Homo']
genome_data = {'species': 'Octopus', 'size': 2700000000}
if species_count==8:
    open('species.fasta', 'r')
```

Readability for the human researcher takes precedence over PEP 8
conformance. Don't run black, ruff-format, or other auto-formatters
that would strip these spaces.

---

## 34. TSV/CSV output conventions: self-documenting headers + tab/comma delimiters

All tabular outputs follow two rules:

### Self-documenting column headers

```
header_ID (header details in human-readable prose)
```

- `header_ID`: underscore-separated identifier
- `header details`: prose explanation in parentheses, with spaces, embedding
  calculation method and data format where relevant

Examples:
```
Orthogroup_ID (orthogroup identifier from OCL data)
Conservation_Rate_Percent (calculated as conservation events divided by conservation plus loss events times 100)
Species_List (comma delimited list of species names in Genus_species format)
```

Headers can be long if needed — clarity is the priority.

### Delimiter convention

- **Between columns**: TAB (`\t`) — the file is a TSV
- **Within a column** (multi-value cells): COMMA (`,`) — pipes (`|`) are
  not used as in-column delimiters

```
# CORRECT (TSV with comma-delimited in-column lists)
Species_List (comma delimited list of species names)
Homo_sapiens,Mus_musculus,Drosophila_melanogaster

# INCORRECT (do not use pipes in columns)
Homo_sapiens|Mus_musculus|Drosophila_melanogaster
```

---

## 35. NextFlow workflow directory naming: template vs run instance

Each NextFlow workflow lives in a directory whose name encodes whether it
is a **template** (committed to git, the canonical source) or a **run
instance** (a user's working copy of that template).

| Form | Meaning | In git? |
|------|---------|---------|
| `workflow-COPYME-<descriptor>/` | Canonical template; the user copies it to run | Yes (tracked) |
| `workflow-RUN_NN-<descriptor>/` | A run instance — copy of the template that executed (or is executing) once. `NN` numbers sequential runs of that workflow. | No (gitignored — `workflow-RUN_*/`) |

Older naming patterns like `nf_workflow-TEMPLATE_NN-<descriptor>/` or
`workflow-RUN_NN_NN-<descriptor>/` are deprecated in favor of the simpler
`workflow-COPYME-*` / `workflow-RUN_NN-*` pair.

The run-instance dirs contain a workflow's full execution artifacts
(`OUTPUT_pipeline/`, `work/`, `.nextflow*`, slurm logs) and never ship
to git.

---

## 36. NextFlow fail-fast: no `optional: true` outputs; `errorStrategy = 'terminate'`; `sys.exit(1)` on missing data

Research pipelines must fail loudly on missing or invalid data — not
silently continue with placeholder values or empty files. Three rules
enforce this:

### Never use `optional: true` in NextFlow outputs

```groovy
// ❌ WRONG — allows silent missing-output to succeed
output:
    path "results.txt", emit: results, optional: true

// ✅ CORRECT — pipeline errors if file is missing
output:
    path "results.txt", emit: results
```

If a process can legitimately produce no output, fix the process to
produce an empty-with-headers file rather than no file. Marking outputs
optional means downstream consumers see "no error" while having no data.

### `errorStrategy = 'terminate'` and `maxErrors = 0` in `nextflow.config`

```groovy
process {
    errorStrategy = { task.attempt <= 2 ? 'retry' : 'terminate' }
    maxRetries = 2
    maxErrors = 0   // stop immediately on first persistent failure
    // Never use errorStrategy = 'ignore'
}
```

Research pipelines want immediate feedback when something goes wrong, not
to discover multiple failures hours later.

### Python pipeline scripts: `sys.exit(1)` on missing data

```python
if not critical_data:
    logger.error( "CRITICAL ERROR: What went wrong" )
    logger.error( "Why this is a problem" )
    logger.error( f"Relevant context: { details }" )
    logger.error( "How to fix it" )
    sys.exit( 1 )   # FAIL
```

Never `sys.exit(0)` when data is missing. Never log "warning" for a
critical issue. Never write a placeholder/empty file and continue. The
script either produced the expected output or it failed — no third state.

---

## 37. Project-level data server: one per project, at `server/`

Each GIGANTIC project ships **one** centralized data server at
`gigantic_project-COPYME/server/`. It is a long-running web service that
gives collaborators HTTP access to selected pipeline outputs across all
subprojects of the project. There is no per-subproject server; subprojects
publish into the single project-level server.

The server is operated through a unified `RUN-start_server.sh` driver
(§29) governed by `execution_mode` in `START_HERE-server_config.yaml`.
Full documentation lives in `server/README.md` (user-facing) and
`server/AI_GUIDE.md` (operation + publishing workflow).

---

## 38. Subproject-to-server interface: `<subproject>/upload_to_server/` + manifests + symlinks

Each subproject exposes selected outputs to the project's data server
through a fixed interface:

- **`<subproject>/upload_to_server/`** is the single publish destination
  per subproject (subproject-level; **never per-STEP, per-BLOCK, or
  per-workflow-RUN** — consumers and the server look in exactly one
  place per subproject). The current state of any subproject with
  `<STEP>/upload_to_server/` dirs is a legacy deviation to be refactored.
- Internal structure inside `upload_to_server/` is **user-facing** —
  organized for collaborators to browse the project, not for GIGANTIC's
  internal bookkeeping. The shared helper's default is to mirror
  producer paths:
  ```
  <subproject>/upload_to_server/
    └── STEP_<N>-<name>/         (or BLOCK_<name>/, or unit-name/)
        └── workflow-RUN_<K>-<name>/   (canonical RUN per §39)
            └── N-output/
                └── <file>       (symlink to the actual output)
  ```
  This default works well when the natural collaborator-facing framework
  IS the producer's structure. Per-manifest `dest_name` overrides can
  reshape paths into a user-defined framework when the natural framework
  for collaborators differs from the internal pipeline layout (e.g.,
  grouping by species set, by hypothesis, by deliverable type rather
  than by STEP).

  Note distinction from `output_to_input/` (§2): `output_to_input/`
  structure **mirrors producer paths** mandatorily (preserves provenance
  for downstream subprojects); `upload_to_server/` structure is for
  human collaborators and **can deviate** from producer paths when a
  different organization serves the user better.
- Each canonical `workflow-RUN_*/` carries its own
  **`upload_manifest.tsv`** controlling which of its outputs publish
  (one manifest per canonical RUN dir; see §39)
- Each subproject has a **`RUN-update_upload_to_server.sh`** at
  subproject level that invokes the shared helper at
  `gigantic_project-COPYME/server/ai/update_upload_to_server.py`. The
  shared helper walks the subproject, finds every `upload_manifest.tsv`
  inside any `workflow-RUN_*/`, and assembles the nested
  `upload_to_server/` tree above.
- The server reads `upload_to_server/` symlinks transparently — **there
  is no copy or sync step**. Follow-the-symlink at HTTP request time.

This parallels the `output_to_input/` symlink pattern (§2) but serves a
different consumer (the data server / collaborators, not downstream
subprojects).

`upload_to_server/` ships only `.gitkeep` + `README.md` + `upload_manifest.tsv`
(canonical templates of the manifest); actual published symlinks are
gitignored as runtime content.

---

## 39. Canonical-RUN rule for publishing — ONE manifest per unit, in the canonical RUN only

When a subproject's workflow has been retried multiple times, the
filesystem can hold `workflow-RUN_1`, `workflow-RUN_2`, `workflow-RUN_3`
in the same step directory. The **canonical** RUN is the one whose
`OUTPUT_pipeline/` is symlinked from `<subproject>/output_to_input/`.
The others are stale.

**Rule**: place `upload_manifest.tsv` **only** in the canonical RUN per
unit. Never leave a stale RUN with its own manifest.

**Why**: if a stale RUN keeps a manifest, the publisher copies its
(partial / wrong / outdated) outputs into `upload_to_server/`
side-by-side with the canonical RUN's outputs. The server then shows
collaborators **two trees** or **two alignments** or **two structure
sets** for the same unit, with no UI hint that one is stale. This is a
**research-integrity failure** under `AI_BEHAVIOR.md`'s zero-tolerance
rule for silent artifacts.

How to find the canonical RUN per unit (example pattern; adapt the file
glob to the subproject):

```bash
SUB=<subproject>
for d in $SUB/output_to_input/*/; do
  unit=$(basename "$d")
  raw=$(ls $d/STEP_*/<canonical-file-glob> 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  if [ -L "$raw" ]; then
    canonical=$(readlink "$raw" | grep -oE 'workflow-RUN_[0-9]+')
    echo "$unit -> $canonical"
  fi
done
```

When in doubt during a publish: dry-run the publisher
(`RUN-update_upload_to_server.sh --dry-run`) and reconcile the file
counts before going live.

Full publishing workflow lives in `server/AI_GUIDE.md` ("Publishing
workflow" section).

---

## 40. Bidirectional discoverability: producer AI_GUIDEs list their consumers

When a subproject, STEP, BLOCK, or workflow **consumes** data from
another subproject's `output_to_input/`, update the **producer's**
relevant AI_GUIDE to note the consumer. This bidirectional cross-
reference makes the data-flow graph navigable from either end.

**Example**: trees_species' STEP that produces species-tree structures
gets a note in its AI_GUIDE saying "downstream consumers: orthogroups_X_ocl
reads these structures; annotations_X_ocl reads them via orthogroups_X_ocl's
output_to_input/."

**Why**: an AI walking into a subproject and finding it produces data
should be able to answer "who uses this?" without grep'ing the whole
tree. The producer-side reference solves this directly. Without it, you
need a separate dependency map (drifts) or a cross-tree search (slow,
incomplete).

**How**: add a "Downstream consumers" section to the producer's relevant
AI_GUIDE (the one closest to the output_to_input/ source) when a
consumer relationship is established. Keep it short:

```markdown
## Downstream consumers

The `output_to_input/<subdir>/` exposed here is read by:

- **<consumer subproject>** — `<consumer subproject>/...` consumes
  `<which file(s) and what for>`. See `<consumer subproject>/AI_GUIDE.md`
  for the consumer side.
```

Apply when surfacing a new producer-consumer pair during cleanup or
during new development.

---

## 41. Subproject internal organization: three natural types (STEP, BLOCK, UNIT)

GIGANTIC subprojects come in three structural shapes, chosen to fit the
scientific use case. Internal structure is **subproject-natural** — do
not force a single shape on all subprojects. (Compare with the
**interface layer** — `upload_to_server/`, `output_to_input/`,
`RUN-update_upload_to_server.sh` at subproject root — which IS
standardized per §2, §38, etc., regardless of internal type.)

| Type | When to use | Internal layout | Examples |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **STEP** | Sequential pipeline; STEP_<N+1> depends on STEP_<N> | `<subproject>/STEP_<N>-<descriptor>/workflow-COPYME-<name>/` | `phylonames` (STEP_1-generate_and_evaluate → STEP_2-apply_user_phylonames); `genomesDB` (STEP_1-sources → ... → STEP_4-create_final_species_set) |
| **BLOCK** | Parallel/alternative tools, methods, or analyses producing comparable outputs | `<subproject>/BLOCK_<descriptor>/workflow-COPYME-<name>/` | `orthogroups` (BLOCK_orthohmm, BLOCK_orthofinder, BLOCK_broccoli — pick your tool); `annotations_hmms` (BLOCK_interproscan, BLOCK_deeploc, BLOCK_signalp — different annotations); `hotspots` (BLOCK_self_blast, BLOCK_identify_hotspots) |
| **UNIT** | Per-unit instances of a templated workflow chain (each unit goes through the same STEP_1 → STEP_2 → ... pipeline) | `<subproject>/<unit_prefix>_COPYME/STEP_<N>/workflow-COPYME-<name>/` (template) and `<subproject>/<unit_prefix>-<name>/STEP_<N>/workflow-COPYME-<name>/` (per-unit instances) | `trees_gene_families` (gene_family_COPYME template + gene_family-<name> instances); `trees_gene_groups` (similar) |

**Mixed or hybrid types**: a subproject occasionally needs more than one
type (e.g., a STEP-organized subproject where one STEP has BLOCK
alternatives inside it). That's fine — apply the type that fits at each
level. Don't invent custom types.

**Naming**:
- `STEP_<N>-<descriptor>` — zero-padded number with descriptive suffix
- `BLOCK_<descriptor>` — no number; BLOCKs are alternatives, not ordered
- `<unit_prefix>_COPYME` for the unit template (e.g., `gene_family_COPYME`)
- `<unit_prefix>-<unit_name>` for unit instances (e.g.,
  `gene_family-innexin_pannexin_channels`)
- `workflow-COPYME-<descriptor>` for the workflow template inside any
  STEP/BLOCK/unit (§35)

---

## 42. "Where this fits" header on every doc

Every `README.md` and `AI_GUIDE.md` opens with a short **"Where this fits"**
block immediately after the AI-attribution comment block (§12), pointing
the reader UP, DOWN, IN, and OUT:

- **UP**: parent README + parent AI_GUIDE (one level up, and project root)
- **DOWN**: child docs (children's READMEs / AI_GUIDEs / workflow runbooks)
- **IN**: where the data this unit consumes comes from (INPUT_user
  staging, upstream subproject `output_to_input/`, conventions docs)
- **OUT**: where this unit's outputs go (`output_to_input/`,
  `upload_to_server/`, downstream consumer subprojects)

The block is **brief** (a 5-line bulleted list, not a section).

**Pattern**:

```markdown
## Where this fits

`<subproject_or_block>` is the <Nth> subproject/BLOCK you run
(<one-line orientation>).

- Parent project landing page: [`../../README.md`](../../README.md)
- Parent project AI guide: [`../../AI_GUIDE.md`](../../AI_GUIDE.md)
- This unit's AI guide: [`AI_GUIDE.md`](AI_GUIDE.md)
- Prerequisite: [`../<upstream>/`](../<upstream>/) (provides X)
- Next step: [`../<downstream>/`](../<downstream>/) (consumes Y)
```

**Why**: any AI or human walking into a directory cold can navigate the
project structure from the first 10 lines of the doc, without grep'ing
or asking. Adopted from the phylonames + genomesDB + trees_species deep
eval passes (2026-05-26).

---

## 43. Up/down/in/out is the canonical doc evaluation framework

When auditing any `README.md` or `AI_GUIDE.md`, check the four-axis
integration explicitly:

1. **UP** — Does it link to parent docs (parent README, parent
   AI_GUIDE, and the project-root pair)?
2. **DOWN** — Does it link to child docs (children's READMEs,
   workflow runbooks, BLOCK guides)?
3. **IN** — Does it name explicitly where this unit's inputs come
   from (INPUT_user staging slot, upstream subproject's
   `output_to_input/<path>/<file>`, NCBI / external data sources)?
4. **OUT** — Does it name explicitly where this unit's outputs go
   (`output_to_input/<subdir>/`, `upload_to_server/`, listed
   downstream consumer subprojects per §40)?

A doc missing any axis is incomplete. Use the framework as a checklist
during deep eval passes (it surfaced multiple integration gaps across
phylonames, genomesDB, and trees_species during the 2026-05-26 pass —
including the entire `BLOCK_user_requests` BLOCK that had shipped without
being added to its subproject README).

---

## 44. Deep eval: cross-check docs against code (main.nf / nextflow.config / scripts / YAML)

Doc-only review is **not enough** for deep eval. Every doc claim about
scripts, output paths, env names, or workflow structure must be
cross-checked against the actual file on disk:

| Doc claim | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Script names + count | `ls workflow-COPYME-*/ai/scripts/` |
| Process names + execution order | `workflow-COPYME-*/ai/main.nf` |
| Conda env name | `workflow-COPYME-*/ai/conda_environment.yml` (`name:` line) |
| YAML keys, defaults, structure | `workflow-COPYME-*/START_HERE-user_config.yaml` |
| Process resources, error strategy | `workflow-COPYME-*/ai/nextflow.config` |
| Actual output filenames | `find workflow-RUN_*/OUTPUT_pipeline/` |
| Symlink targets | `ls -la <subproject>/output_to_input/*/maps/` |

The genomesDB workflow-level deep eval pass (2026-05-26, commit
`332e2f5`) surfaced multiple recurring doc-vs-reality mismatches that
sed cleanup could not catch — wrong script-count tables, fictional
script names, output paths off by one directory level, a fictional
`6_ai-species_selection_manifest.tsv` referenced across 5 docs that
never existed. **Cross-checking against code catches what doc-only
review misses.**

---

## 45. `write_run_log` is the canonical final script in every NextFlow workflow

Every workflow's NextFlow `main.nf` ends with a `write_run_log` process
that invokes `NNN_ai-python-write_run_log.py` (highest script number in
the workflow's `ai/scripts/` directory). The script writes a
timestamped per-run audit log to the workflow's `ai/logs/` directory.

This is **easy to forget in doc tables** — the recurring failure mode
is documenting "the 6 analysis scripts" without mentioning script 007
write_run_log, then someone reads the doc and is confused when there are
N+1 scripts on disk. Always include `write_run_log` in script tables;
mark it explicitly as the audit-log final step.

The script's role:
- Records workflow name, subproject name, project name, status, timestamp
- Writes to `ai/logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS-<subproject>_success.log`
- Is **per-run** — separate from project-wide chat captures (§9), which
  live in `research_notebook/research_ai/sessions/`

---

## 46. Anti-pattern: nested `slurm:` block in `START_HERE-user_config.yaml`

Pre-§29 templates carried a nested YAML block:

```yaml
slurm:
  enabled: false
  account: "your_account"
  qos: "your_qos"
  memory: "4gb"
  time: "1:00:00"
  cpus: 1
```

This is **dead code** — §29's unified `RUN-workflow.sh` driver reads
only the flat keys at the bottom of the YAML:

```yaml
execution_mode: "local"        # or "slurm"
slurm_account: "your_account"
slurm_qos: "your_qos"
cpus: 2
memory_gb: 8
time_hours: 2
```

When found in a YAML, the stale nested `slurm:` block should be
removed. (Surfaced and removed from genomesDB STEP_1 YAML during the
2026-05-26 cleanup; verified absent in genomesDB STEP_2/3/4 + phylonames
STEP_1/2.)

---

## 47. Frozen-artifact rule: `workflow-RUN_*/` docs are historical, not canonical

When a `workflow-RUN_<K>-*/` directory exists alongside its
`workflow-COPYME-*/` template, the RUN dir is a **frozen research
artifact** — a snapshot of the workflow as it was when that specific
run happened. Its embedded `README.md` and `ai/AI_GUIDE.md` are
historical documentation of that run.

**Rule**: canonical-pattern refactors and doc-cleanup passes touch
**only** `workflow-COPYME-*` docs. Leave `workflow-RUN_*` docs alone.

**Why**: editing the RUN docs would rewrite the historical record of
what the workflow looked like when it executed. Reproducibility and the
research-notebook nature of the project require those artifacts stay
frozen.

(See also: §39 canonical-RUN rule for publishing — only the canonical
RUN gets a live `upload_manifest.tsv`; stale RUNs are left untouched.)

---

## 48. Quick Reference navigation table at top of every AI_GUIDE

Every `AI_GUIDE.md` carries a navigation table near the top, after the
AI-attribution block and the "Where this fits" block (§42), listing
**every related doc the reader might want next**:

```markdown
## Quick Reference

| User needs... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| GIGANTIC overview | `../../AI_GUIDE.md` (project root) |
| Conventions (§1–§58) | `../../ai/ai_FYIs/gigantic_conventions.md` |
| <subproject> concepts | This file |
| <BLOCK or STEP> overview | `<BLOCK_or_STEP>/AI_GUIDE.md` |
| Running the workflow | `<...>/workflow-COPYME-*/ai/AI_GUIDE.md` |
| Downstream subprojects | `../<consumer>/AI_GUIDE.md` |
```

The Quick Reference is **denser than "Where this fits"** (§42) — it's a
full pointer-list for AI navigation, while "Where this fits" is a
3-sentence orientation. They serve different purposes and **both
appear** in every AI_GUIDE.

Adopted from the phylonames + genomesDB + trees_species deep eval
passes (2026-05-26). The pattern was already in some AI_GUIDEs before
the pass but not uniformly applied.

---

## 49. `z_*` gitignore pattern — early-development dirs visible, contents ignored

Parallels the existing `x_*` pattern but with different intent:

| Prefix | Intent | Lifecycle |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| `x_*`  | Staged for eventual removal | Was canonical, now superseded |
| `z_*`  | Staged as early-development, not for general use yet | Future-canonical |

Both sort to the ends of alphabetical listings.

By default, files and dirs prefixed with `z_` are gitignored. To make a `z_`
**directory** visible on github (so its presence signals future framework
direction in higher-level docs), add a `README.md` inside it — `README.md`
is the only filename un-ignored within `z_*` dirs.

Pattern in root `.gitignore` (the `**/` prefixes are necessary because `z_`
dirs can live at any depth):

```gitignore
z_*
!**/z_*/
**/z_*/**
!**/z_*/README.md
```

Without `**/`, the content-ignore rule fires only at the repo root and
misses the actual targets (e.g.,
`gigantic_project-COPYME/subprojects/z_foo/`).

Adopted 2026-05-26 (commit `dbe8d89`) after renames of
`ocl_perspectives → z_ocl_perspectives`,
`ocl_using_simple_taxonomy → z_ocl_using_simple_taxonomy`,
`parsimony_tree_structures → z_parsimony_tree_structures`,
`synteny → z_synteny`.

---

## 50. Per-subproject `research_notebook/` migration procedure

Per §1, per-subproject `research_notebook/` directories are forbidden;
content belongs in the single project-root sandbox under
`research_notebook/research_user/subproject-<name>/`. When deep-eval
encounters a surviving per-subproject `research_notebook/`, migrate in this
order:

1. **`mkdir -p`** the destination
   `gigantic_project-COPYME/research_notebook/research_user/subproject-<name>/`
2. **`git rm --cached`** any tracked files in the old `research_notebook/`
   (papers, summaries, manifests) — keeps them on disk, removes from index.
   Tracked content there is anomalous per §25; untrack rather than carry
   forward.
3. **`mv`** the remaining (already-untracked) directories and files to the
   destination via plain `mv` — gitignored at both old and new path.
4. **`git rm`** the per-subproject `.gitkeep`.
5. **`rmdir`** the now-empty per-subproject `research_notebook/`.

Document the move in the commit message including which files were
untracked (they remain on disk; user may later choose to re-track elsewhere
if a paper summary is intentionally part of the scientific record).

Migration order matters: `git rm --cached` must precede `mv` so the
destination doesn't end up holding a tracked-but-would-be-ignored file (a
confusing state).

Established across phylonames + genomesDB + trees_species (commit
`6186551`), trees_gene_families (commit `61ef05a`), annotations_hmms +
gene_sizes (commits `f763ba0`, `ab6ad1b`).

---

## 51. Missing-doc-create-on-deep-eval policy

When a deep-eval pass encounters a subproject, BLOCK, or workflow with no
`README.md` and/or no `AI_GUIDE.md` at the expected level, **create** the
missing docs from scratch — do not skip with "no docs to update."

Derive content from:
- `main.nf` top-of-file comments (design overview, process list)
- Top-of-file comments and docstrings in `ai/scripts/*`
- `START_HERE-user_config.yaml` (parameter shape, references)
- Directory structure (BLOCKs, STEPs, workflow templates)
- Sibling subprojects' docs for cross-reference targets

Use the current detailed-eval date in the AI-attribution HTML block
(per §12) so the creation pass is dated and attributable.

Recent examples: dark_proteomes was created from 0 docs → 5 docs in commit
`e128e0b`; homolog_counts gained a missing subproject README + workflow
README in commit `4898c21`.

This is the doc-side counterpart to §44 (cross-check docs against code) —
when docs *don't exist*, the deep-eval pass owes a baseline doc set.

---

## 52. Sed-induced `RUN-workflow.sh` duplicate cleanup after §29 conversion

After bulk `sed -i 's|RUN-workflow\.sbatch|RUN-workflow.sh|g'` (per §29
unification), old dir trees and Key Files tables that previously listed
both files as adjacent rows now show two identical `RUN-workflow.sh`
lines. Detection pattern:

```bash
for f in $(find <subproject> -name '*.md' -not -path '*/x_*' -not -path '*/workflow-RUN_*'); do
  awk 'prev~/RUN-workflow\.sh/ && $0~/RUN-workflow\.sh/ {print FILENAME ":" NR ": " $0} {prev=$0}' "$f"
done
```

**Cleanup**: merge each duplicate pair into a **single** entry annotated
with `(local or SLURM via execution_mode YAML per §29)`. Do not delete
both — preserve the row so the file's existence is documented; just
collapse the duplicate.

Common dup contexts:
- Workflow `Key Files` tables: "Local runner" + "SLURM wrapper" rows
- Directory trees in BLOCK / subproject docs: adjacent `RUN-workflow.sh`
  + (formerly) `RUN-workflow.sbatch` lines

Established in gene_sizes (commit `ab6ad1b`).

## 53. Single-BLOCK subproject conda env naming — tolerated short form

§28 mandates `aiG-<subproject>-<block_or_step>` for per-BLOCK conda envs.
For **single-BLOCK subprojects**, the short form `aiG-<subproject>` is
tolerated (and currently in use), e.g.:

- `aiG-dark_proteomes` (one BLOCK: `BLOCK_classify_dark_proteome`)

Functional impact is zero (no naming collision possible when there's only
one BLOCK), and the short form is more legible in conda activation
commands. Doc this deviation in the subproject's README + BLOCK AI_GUIDE
so future readers know it's deliberate.

Stricter §28 form remains preferred for **multi-BLOCK** subprojects (e.g.,
`aiG-annotations_hmms-tmbed` — six tool BLOCKs, each with its own env).

If a single-BLOCK subproject grows a second BLOCK later, the short form
should be expanded to the strict §28 form at that time.

## 54. Bundled-payload accidental-commit followup-note protocol

When two parallel sessions (e.g., one in trees_gene_groups, one in
annotations_hmms) cause one session to inadvertently stage and commit the
other's in-progress work, **do not rewrite history**. Add a followup
commit:

- **Title**: `note: <hash> bundled an unintended payload`
- **Body**: explain what was bundled, confirm it's not destructive, link
  the two payloads from the commit title so future readers can untangle

Example: commit `7b05f62` (followup to `ad2c9cc`) — the STEP_2 SLURM
JobName change inadvertently swept in 14 file renames + 1 deletion from
the annotations_hmms in-progress session. The followup note documented
both payloads.

This avoids destructive history rewrites and produces a discoverable audit
trail. If the bundle WAS destructive (rather than just incomplete in the
title), the response would instead be a revert + redo — different protocol.

---

## 55. Untracking previously-tracked files in `research_user/`

§25 mandates that `research_notebook/research_user/` ships only
`.gitignore` (and `.gitkeep`-style markers). When deep-eval discovers
historic tracked content there (e.g., paper summaries committed before §25
was formalized, or migrated in from a per-subproject `research_notebook/`
where they were tracked):

- **`git rm --cached <file>`** — removes from index, keeps on disk
- File continues to live at the new (sandbox) path, gitignored
- Document the untracking in the commit message

Rationale: the §25 separation is the load-bearing rule that lets
`research_user/` stay completely free-form while GIGANTIC's
reproducibility guarantees remain intact. Tracked paper summaries violate
that separation. They can be re-tracked elsewhere later (a curated
literature index in `paper_preparation/` for example) if the user wants
them in the scientific record.

Example: gene_sizes commit `ab6ad1b` untracked two paper summaries
(mccoy_fire 2020, mccoy_fire 2024) from the migrated sandbox; the files
remain on disk under `research_user/subproject-gene_sizes/ai_research/`.

---

## 56. Workflow-level `README.md` is mandatory at every `workflow-COPYME-*/` root

Refines §35: every `workflow-COPYME-*/` directory ships BOTH:

- `README.md` at the workflow root — user-facing quick start + I/O
- `ai/AI_GUIDE.md` — AI-facing execution guide

When deep-eval encounters a workflow with only `ai/AI_GUIDE.md` and no
top-level `README.md`, create the README. Pattern: each workflow README
contains AI-attribution block + §42 Where-this-fits + Purpose + Usage
+ Inputs + Outputs + See-Also (pointer to `ai/AI_GUIDE.md`).

Example added: homolog_counts workflow README in commit `4898c21`.

---

## 57. Deep-eval per-subproject single-commit-per-subproject rhythm

The deep-eval sweep proceeds **one subproject at a time** with **one
commit + push per subproject** when working through multiple subprojects.
This gives a clean per-subproject changelog where each commit's diff
exactly covers one subproject's surface area.

Format of each commit message:
- **Title**: `<subproject>: <action> — bring to phylonames/genomesDB depth`
- **Body** sections:
  - Migration / structural changes (research_notebook, renames)
  - Bulk sed details
  - Doc enrichment (per-file changes)
  - Out-of-scope items explicitly listed
  - Stats line at end

Established 2026-05-26 across the 8-subproject sweep (annotations_hmms
`f763ba0` / dark_proteomes `e128e0b` / gene_sizes `ab6ad1b` /
homolog_counts `4898c21` / …).

Don't bundle multiple subprojects into one omnibus commit unless the user
explicitly asks (the omnibus pattern was used for trees_gene_families +
trees_gene_groups in commit `61ef05a`, but per-subproject is preferred
when working a list).

## 58. `x_*` gitignore pattern — archive-for-later-deletion

Parallels §49 `z_*` but with opposite intent:

| Prefix | Intent | Lifecycle |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| `x_*`  | Archive — staged for later deletion (was canonical, now superseded) | Past |
| `z_*`  | Early-development, not for general use yet                          | Future |

Both sort to the ends of alphabetical listings.

`x_*` is the simpler of the two: top-level gitignore pattern `x_*` ignores
files and dirs at any depth (basename match — no `**/` prefix needed).
No "keep README visible" exception — archived content is fully gitignored.

Used to set aside superseded code/templates/RUN dirs without deleting them
immediately, in case they're useful for reference or post-mortem. Eventually
deletable once nothing references them.

Pattern in root `.gitignore` (line 7):

```gitignore
x_*
```

Common occurrences:
- `x_workflow-COPYME-<old_design>-pre_<date>/` — superseded workflow templates
- `x_RUN-update_upload_to_server.sh-pre_helper_migration_<date>` — superseded scripts
- `x_<subproject>-archive-<date>/` — fully-retired subprojects

### When to use `x_` vs `z_`

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Past-canonical code being kept temporarily for reference, then deleted | `x_` |
| Brand-new code under development, not yet ready for general use | `z_` |
| Deprecated but might come back / unclear which direction | Default to `x_` (deprecation is the active framing) and rename to `z_` only if it does come back into active development |

The two prefixes are NOT interchangeable — they signal opposite trajectories
in the lifecycle. `x_` says "going away," `z_` says "coming up."

## 59. GIGANTIC toolkits — optional NextFlow workflows for outside-subproject work

A **GIGANTIC toolkit** is a NextFlow workflow that users can **optionally**
run for work **outside** any gigantic subproject — typically to produce
inputs that gigantic subprojects then consume. Toolkits are developed
during GIGANTIC work, follow GIGANTIC conventions for structure and
naming, but are explicitly NOT first-class subprojects: their inputs are
too variable across genome projects for the framework to take ownership.

**Why toolkits exist as a separate concept**: Some prep work (e.g.,
downloading and processing public reference genomes) is genuinely
user-responsibility because the choices vary too much from project to
project to be standardized (which databases, which assembly versions,
which filters, which subsetting policy). But the same prep work recurs
across projects, so we keep the working code in the shipped framework
as a reusable starting point — a toolkit — rather than have every user
reinvent it.

### Where toolkits live

Inside the user's research sandbox, scoped to the downstream subproject
they feed:

```
gigantic_project-COPYME/research_notebook/research_user/subproject-<X>/<toolkit_name>/
```

For example, the canonical seed toolkit:

```
gigantic_project-COPYME/research_notebook/research_user/subproject-genomesDB/
└── ncbi_genomes-gigantic_T1_toolkit/
    ├── README.md
    ├── output_to_input/         # toolkit outputs that genomesDB consumes
    │   ├── gene_annotations/
    │   ├── genomes/
    │   ├── maps/
    │   └── T1_proteomes/
    └── toolkit-COPYME-<descriptor>/   # user-copied workflow instance
        ├── ai/
        │   ├── main.nf
        │   ├── nextflow.config
        │   └── scripts/
        ├── INPUT_user/
        ├── README.md
        ├── RUN_<name>.sh
        └── <name>_config.yaml
```

### Distinguishing features vs. gigantic subproject workflows

| Aspect | Subproject workflow (`workflow-COPYME-*`) | Toolkit (`toolkit-COPYME-*`) |
|---|---|---|
| Location | `subprojects/<name>/<BLOCK_or_STEP>/workflow-COPYME-*/` | `research_notebook/research_user/subproject-<X>/<toolkit>/toolkit-COPYME-*/` |
| Required to run subproject? | Yes — canonical pipeline | No — optional convenience for outside prep |
| Inputs | INPUT_user/ (per §17, §18) | Toolkit-local INPUT_user/ + user-staged data |
| Outputs | `output_to_input/` for downstream subprojects (per §2) | Toolkit-local `output_to_input/`, then user symlinks/copies into subproject INPUT slot |
| Naming of run driver | Canonical `RUN-workflow.sh` (per §29) | Toolkit-defined (e.g., `RUN_<name>.sh`); not bound to §29 |
| YAML config name | Canonical `START_HERE-user_config.yaml` | Toolkit-defined (e.g., `<name>_config.yaml`) |
| Ships in framework? | Yes — `workflow-COPYME-*` is the template | Yes — `toolkit-COPYME-*` is the template; explicit gitignore exception per §59 |
| Subject to §47 frozen-RUN rule? | Yes for `workflow-RUN_*/` | Same convention applies for toolkit RUN dirs |

### Toolkit gitignore exception pattern

Because toolkits live inside `research_notebook/research_user/` (which
defaults to wild-west sandbox per §25), they require an **explicit
gitignore re-include** in both the top-level `.gitignore` and the
nested `research_notebook/.gitignore`:

```gitignore
!**/research_notebook/research_user/subproject-<X>/<toolkit_name>/
!**/research_notebook/research_user/subproject-<X>/<toolkit_name>/**
```

These rules must appear **before** the `x_*` / `**/x_*` rules so x_*
backups inside the toolkit still stay ignored per §58.

### Current toolkits

- `subproject-genomesDB/ncbi_genomes-gigantic_T1_toolkit/` — downloads
  NCBI reference genomes (GCFs), unzips/organizes/renames per GIGANTIC
  conventions, extracts T1 (longest-transcript) proteomes, and produces
  the `output_to_input/T1_proteomes/`, `genomes/`, `gene_annotations/`,
  and `maps/` content that genomesDB STEP_2 consumes as user-provided
  input.

### When to promote a toolkit to a full subproject

If the prep work stops being variable across projects — i.e., a single
canonical workflow becomes correct for every reasonable use case — the
toolkit can graduate to a real subproject under `subprojects/`. Until
then, "toolkit" is the right framing: shipped because reusable, but
not framework-owned because user-customized.

See also: §49 (`z_*` early-development counterpart).

## 60. GIGANTIC is consumed, not extended — user mods are expected; new user subprojects are out of scope

GIGANTIC is a framework users **consume**: they clone it, copy the
project template, and run the shipped subprojects on their data. They
do not build GIGANTIC itself.

Users will modify their copy wildly — adjusting scripts, configs,
workflow logic, even pipeline structure to fit their project. This is
expected and supported. The framework ships canonical, opinionated
defaults so the user has a sensible starting point; what they do from
there is their own.

If a user wants to **add a new subproject** (a new
`subprojects/<their_thing>/` with their own workflows, scripts, and
conventions), that is fine — but:

- It is **out of scope** for GIGANTIC framework guidance.
- It is **not** subject to GIGANTIC convention review or conformance.
- The shipped conventions remain available as reference if the user
  wants to mirror them, but the framework does not require this.

This is distinct from §59 (toolkits): toolkits are framework-shipped,
framework-owned, and conform to GIGANTIC conventions. User-added
subprojects are user-shipped, user-owned, and free of framework
expectations.

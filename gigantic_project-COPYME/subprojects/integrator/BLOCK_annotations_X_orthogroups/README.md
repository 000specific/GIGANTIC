# BLOCK_annotations_X_orthogroups

Integrates **pfam annogroups** (annotation groups) with **orthogroups**, anchored
on shared member proteins and focused on **non-bilaterian-metazoan** orthogroups
(present in non-bilaterian metazoans, absent from bilaterians).

## Where this fits

- Parent (subproject): [`../README.md`](../README.md) · [`../AI_GUIDE.md`](../AI_GUIDE.md)
- This BLOCK's AI guide: [`AI_GUIDE.md`](AI_GUIDE.md)
- Workflow: [`workflow-COPYME-annotations_X_orthogroups/`](workflow-COPYME-annotations_X_orthogroups/)
- Inputs: pfam annogroups (`ocl_phylogenetic_structures/BLOCK_annotations_X_ocl`), orthogroups (`orthogroups/BLOCK_orthohmm_GIGANTIC`), Bilateria species set (`trees_species`) — see AI guide
- Outputs: `../output_to_input/BLOCK_annotations_X_orthogroups/<run_label>/`

## What you get

1. **Table 1 — annogroups X orthogroups** (one row per annogroup). An annogroup
   is **kept** when at least one of the orthogroups its member proteins fall into
   is **qualifying**; annogroups with no qualifying orthogroup are dropped. Every
   orthogroup of a kept annogroup is reported, grouped by the four composition
   classes (non_bilaterian_metazoan, non_metazoan_only, bilaterian_only,
   mixed_with_bilaterian) with per-class counts + ID lists + pfam
   accessions/definitions.
2. **Table 2 — non-bilaterian-metazoan orthogroups** (one row per orthogroup):
   every **qualifying** orthogroup.

The research question: *which pfam annotation groups are represented in
orthogroups present in non-bilaterian metazoans but absent from bilaterians?*

## In one sentence

A **qualifying orthogroup** has **zero bilaterian members AND ≥1 non-bilaterian
metazoan member** (sponge, cnidarian, ctenophore, placozoan). Non-metazoan /
unicellular outgroup members may ride along, but an orthogroup made of *only*
non-metazoan unicells does **not** qualify — just like any bilaterian-containing
orthogroup. Bilateria = `C103_Bilateria` and Metazoa = `C082_Metazoa` (from
`trees_species`); non-bilaterian metazoan = in Metazoa but not in Bilateria. The
annogroup↔orthogroup link is shared member proteins (full GIGANTIC IDs); the
integration is **structure-independent** (no per-structure fan-out).

## Quick start

```bash
cd workflow-COPYME-annotations_X_orthogroups   # (copy to workflow-RUN_N for a real run)
# 1. Edit START_HERE-user_config.yaml: run_label, annogroup_subtypes,
#    execution_mode (+ slurm_account/slurm_qos if slurm), input paths
# 2. Run:
bash RUN-workflow.sh
```

See [`workflow-COPYME-annotations_X_orthogroups/README.md`](workflow-COPYME-annotations_X_orthogroups/README.md)
for the runbook and [`AI_GUIDE.md`](AI_GUIDE.md) for the join design + output schema.

## Status

Built 2026-06-09 — scaffold, scripts, and docs complete; the join logic was
**validated end-to-end against real species70_pfam_X_OrthoHMM data** (validation
PASS). Server publishing (`upload_to_server/`) will be wired after first-run review.

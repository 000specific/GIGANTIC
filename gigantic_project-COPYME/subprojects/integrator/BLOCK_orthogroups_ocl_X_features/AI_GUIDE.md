## What this BLOCK does

For each phylogenetic species-tree structure, it integrates the OCL
orthogroup analysis with three per-gene feature sources (dark proteome,
hotspots, secretome), keyed on each orthogroup's member sequence IDs. See
`../AI_GUIDE.md` for the full join model, join keys, structure-invariance, and
species-set policy.

## Output tables (per structure)

Three tables per structure, written under
`OUTPUT_pipeline/structure_NNN/`:

### Table 1 — integrated orthogroup summary (`2-output/`)
One row per (structure, orthogroup): OCL spine columns (origin block/state/path,
conservation/loss/continued-absence counts, species count) + member
`Sequence_IDs` + per-source `*_Integration_Count`, `*_Integration_Sequence_IDs`,
and `*_Members_Available_Count` (the count's denominator, for transparency).

### Table 2 — block-state expanded (`3-output/`)
One row per (structure, orthogroup, phylogenetic block-state), carrying the
orthogroup's integration **counts** on each block where the orthogroup has a
**meaningful** state: **O = Origin, P = Conservation, L = Loss**. Lets a user
ask "at the node where this orthogroup originated / is conserved / was lost,
how many member genes integrate with each source?"

> **Counts-only (size decision, 2026-06-04, user-approved)**: Table 2 carries
> the integration *counts* (+ member count + availability) per block-state, NOT
> the sequence-ID list cells. Repeating the full member-ID lists on every
> block-state row produced ~20 GB/structure (~2 TB across 105). The actual IDs
> live once-per-orthogroup in Table 1 and per-gene in Table 3 — join on
> `Orthogroup_ID` to recover them for any block-state row.

> **Design decision (documented, revisitable)**: inherited-absence states
> **A** and **X** are intentionally **excluded** — the orthogroup is absent on
> those blocks, so there are no member genes to integrate. If absence rows are
> wanted later, add them in Script 003.

### Table 3 — gene-level drill-down (`4-output/`)
One row per (structure, orthogroup, member gene): the gene's `Is_Dark` /
`In_Hotspot` / `Hotspot_ID` / `Is_Secreted` plus the secretome **evidence**
columns (SignalP call/probability, DeepLoc Extracellular/Transmembrane, Pfam
counts), carrying the orthogroup's origin block/state for context. This is
where the richer per-gene evidence lives (Table 1/2 keep count + ID-list cells).

A structure-invariant gene→feature lookup
(`OUTPUT_pipeline/_shared/1-output/1_ai-gene_feature_lookup.tsv`) and a
per-species availability summary are built once and feed all three tables.

## Pipeline (6 scripts + utils)

| # | Script | Process | Function |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 001 | `build_feature_lookup.py` | `build_feature_lookup` (singleton) | Build the structure-invariant gene→feature lookup + availability summary; fail-fast if no source has data |
| 002 | `build_integrated_summary.py` | `build_integrated_summary` (per structure) | Table 1 — join lookup onto the OCL orthogroup summary |
| 003 | `build_block_state_expanded.py` | `build_block_state_expanded` (per structure) | Table 2 — explode Table 1 across O/P/L block-states from OCL path_states |
| 004 | `build_gene_drilldown.py` | `build_gene_drilldown` (per structure) | Table 3 — one row per member gene with features + evidence |
| 005 | `validate_results.py` | `validate_results` (per structure) | Cross-check tables (counts vs id-lists vs availability; Table 3 row total; Table 2 referential integrity); fail-fast per §36 |
| 006 | `write_run_log.py` | `write_run_log` | Timestamped run log per §45 |
| — | `utils_integrator.py` | — | Shared helpers (config, ID parsing, header indexing, `DELIM`) |

Scripts are sequential per structure but parallel across structures (NextFlow
manages this); the `_shared` lookup is built once and gates the per-structure
fan-out.

## Delimiter

In-column sequence-ID lists use **bare commas** (`,`) per §34.

# AI: Claude Code | Opus 4.8 | 2026 June 28 | Purpose: Adapt a producer's native group output into the STANDARD sequence-group membership (SequenceGroup_ID, Sequence_Identifier, Genus_Species)
# Human: Eric Edsinger

"""
Script 001 — Adapt a producer's sequence-group set into the standard membership.

This subproject resolves ANY "sequence group" onto the species-tree clades. The one
producer-specific step is reading the group set's native output into a single
STANDARD membership table; every downstream script (deconvolution, per-species map,
composite clades) reads only that standard table, so they are producer-agnostic.

Standard membership (1-output/1_ai-<group_set_label>-sequence_group_membership.tsv):
    SequenceGroup_ID  Sequence_Identifier  Genus_Species
one row per (member sequence, group).

Producers (config 'producer'):
  - orthogroups : reads orthogroups_gigantic_ids.tsv, a row per orthogroup
        OG_id <TAB> member_seq_id <TAB> member_seq_id <TAB> ...
    where each member id embeds its phyloname after '-n_' (Genus_species parsed
    from there). Adding a producer = add a small reader branch here; nothing
    downstream changes.

Fail-fast (§36): exits 1 if the input is missing, the producer is unknown, the
output is empty, or any member id has no parseable Genus_species (silent loss).

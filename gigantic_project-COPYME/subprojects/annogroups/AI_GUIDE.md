Purpose: AI guide for the annogroups subproject — the annogroup concept, the
         four canonical types, locked design decisions, and where to go next.
Scope:   The annogroups subproject (LEVEL 2 of the AI_GUIDE hierarchy).

# AI_GUIDE — annogroups (subproject)

**For AI assistants**: Read [`../../AI_GUIDE.md`](../../AI_GUIDE.md) first for the
GIGANTIC overview, directory structure, and general patterns. This guide covers
annogroups-specific concepts. For running the build, read the workflow guide
([`BLOCK_build_annogroups/workflow-COPYME-build_annogroups/ai/AI_GUIDE.md`](BLOCK_build_annogroups/workflow-COPYME-build_annogroups/ai/AI_GUIDE.md)).

## What an annogroup is

An **annogroup** is a set of sequences grouped by a shared annotation feature,
computed **per source database**. A **feature** = `(source, annotation_identifier)`
from `annotations_hmms` — the general unit, not just a domain (it covers motifs,
sites, family assignments, topology segments, etc.).

An annogroup is **always in reference to a source database**. The source is part
of the identity and the identifier (`annogroup_pfam_…`, `annogroup_tmbed_…`), so
the same scheme extends across every annotation source without collision.

## The four canonical types (canonical terms — use exactly)

| Type | Definition | Identifier | Map? |
|------|-----------|------------|------|
| `annogroup_feature` | sequences sharing one feature (multi-membership: a sequence is in one feature annogroup per distinct feature it has) | `annogroup_<source>_<accession>` | no (natural ID) |
| `annogroup_combination` | sequences sharing the same **distinct set** of features (unordered; key = alphabetically-sorted distinct accessions; copies ignored) | `annogroup_<source>_combination<NNNNN>` | yes |
| `annogroup_architecture` | sequences sharing the same **ordered arrangement** of positional features (N→C by `(start, stop)`) | `annogroup_<source>_architecture<NNNNN>` | yes |
| `annogroup_absent` | sequences in the proteome universe with **no** feature from the source | `annogroup_<source>_absent` | no (one per source) |

## Locked design decisions (do NOT re-litigate — user-approved 2026-06-18)

1. **Architecture grouping key is coord-FREE** (the ordered accession pattern),
   so homologs with shifted coordinates group together. Each sequence's
   **coordinate-tagged** architecture (`PF00001_start10_stop50,…`) is stored on
   its **membership row**, not in the shared key.
2. **Combination = distinct set, alphabetical** canonical key.
3. **`absent` needs the full proteome universe** (genomesDB STEP_4). Each
   sequence is independently evaluated by the source, so "no annotation" is a
   per-sequence fact — but to enumerate *complete* `absent` membership the source
   must have been run over every proteome in the species set.
4. **One parser plugin per source** (`parsers/<source>.py`); the four-type
   construction is shared. New source = new parser, nothing else.
5. **How many types a source yields (3 or 4) is data-determined**, not a knob.
6. **Counter IDs are deterministic** (sort canonical keys, then number) — same
   input always yields the same IDs.
7. **All inter-subproject I/O via `output_to_input/`** (§2) — no other path.

## Where annogroups sit in the dependency chain

```
annotations_hmms (per-source features) ─┐
                                         ├─► annogroups ─► OCL, integrator
genomesDB STEP_4 (proteome universe) ────┘
```

`annogroups` replaces the old ad-hoc `single`/`combo`/`zero` scheme that used to
live inside `annotations_X_ocl` Script 001. Downstream restructuring to *consume*
annogroups (rather than recompute groupings) is a planned later phase — see the
BLOCK guide.

## Status

Built 2026-06-18. **pfam validated end-to-end** (137,762 annogroups across the
four types; validation PASS; full NextFlow DAG run). One known, user-accepted
data caveat: a handful of truncated multi-locus annotation IDs are dropped — see
`BLOCK_build_annogroups/workflow-COPYME-build_annogroups/ai/ai_FYIs/WARNING-truncated_orphan_annotations.md`.
Additional source parsers and downstream restructuring are later phases.
